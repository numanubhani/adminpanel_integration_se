## 🚀 Next Steps

### **Restart Backend:**

Since we modified the serializers, restart the backend to load the updated code:

```powershell
# Stop backend (Ctrl + C in terminal)
# Then restart:
cd C:\Users\PMLS\Desktop\adminpanel_integration_se\backend
python manage.py runserver
```

**Kept:** Local image preview in My Info page (UI only)  
**Status:** Backend serializers updated, no migration needed  
**Action Required:** Restart backend  

**The codebase is now back to the state before image upload was added!** ✅
